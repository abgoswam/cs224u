\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:futurework}

We identify some strands of work for future:

\begin{enumerate}

\item
We want to build Transformer based models for Adverserial NLI and compare them with non-deep learning models. We hope that a comparison of these approaches for the task of Adverserial NLI will give us some grounds to build up more intuition about the Adversarial NLI task.
 
\item
We want to explore whether the role attributed to multi-headed attention in the non-adversarial setting also holds true for adversarial models. The hunch we have is that attention heads will have a markedly different role in the adversarial setting given the nature of the data.

\item
We want to study the role of positional embeddings in the adversarial setting. 

\end{enumerate}
