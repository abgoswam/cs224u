\section{General Problem}
\label{sec:general problem}

The general problem we are trying to address is Natural Language Inference (NLI), the task of determining if a premise sentence entails a hypothesis statement. In recent years, Transformer-based models have been shown to be very effective in this task.

In particular, we study the problem of Adversarial NLI \cite{nie2019adversarial} which poses a challenge to the state-of-the-art models. We then study the structural properties of a popular deep learning model, BERT \cite{devlin-etal-2019-bert} from the perspective of what it does \cite{michel2019sixteen, rogers2020primer, clark2019does}.
