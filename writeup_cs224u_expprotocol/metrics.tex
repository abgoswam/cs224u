\section{Metrics}
\label{sec:metrics}

A description of the metrics that will form the basis for evaluation. We require at least one of these to be quantitative metrics, but we are very open-minded about which ones you choose. In requiring this, we are not saying that all work in NLU needs to be evaluated quantitatively, but rather just that we think it is a healthy requirement for our course.
