\section{General Problem}
\label{sec:general problem}

There two general problem we are trying to explore:  (1) The role played by attention mechanisms in transformer based models. (2) The Natural Language Inference (NLI) task in the adversarial setting. In recent years attention-based Transformer models have been show to be very effective for the NLI task. But they have some shortcomings, especially in adversarial scenarios.
